        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my journey into coding when I was looking to find a job that wouldn't leave me watching the clock all day. While I enjoyed my roles as an accounting professional and a data specialist, I was searching for something that would allow me more flexibility, autonomy and the opportunity to continually learn new things.</p>
        <p>After dabbling online and then taking a few college classes, I was hooked! As a Thinkful student, I am reaping the benefits of collaborating with a mentor and other students to propel me to my next career.</p>
        <p>Outside of development, I spend my time playing with my two sons, taking long walks outdoors and reading books about self-improvement, psychology and sociology.</p>
